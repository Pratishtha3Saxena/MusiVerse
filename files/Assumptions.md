The assumptions are as follows:

-Some images are from urls on the internet and hence require internet access. Others (such as specific logos/design elements) have been pasted directly in the folder.
-The site is designed to work best on fullscreen mode, but works fairly well on smaller sizes.
-The search page primarily searches for top songs as opposed to albums or artists and returns results accordingly.
-The clear filter button returns the filters to default values only.
